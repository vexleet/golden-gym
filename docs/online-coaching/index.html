                <p>Because we personally travel as often as possible and work with MANY entrepreneurs or traveling
                    workers, we know how difficult it can be to stick to the plan on the road. Don’t worry about all
                    that, we got you covered!
                    We will contact the hotel or place of stay and create an adjustable training program to fit whatever
                    is available for you to work with. We then search surrounding areas to help you come up with an
                    appropriate nutritional strategy to enjoy the area while keeping your diet on track.</p>

                <p>195lbs to 195lb, complete body recomposition! All done in less than 12 weeks!</p>

                <p>“When I first started training with Mike, I wondered how someone much younger than I am could relate
                    to my goals and create training that would help me reach them. What I discovered is that what
                    separates Mike from others I’ve worked with in the past, is his relentless pursuit of knowledge and
                    how he can apply that specifically to me and my goals. A great thing for my personal style is that
                    Mike explains the reasons and/or background behind what we’re working on. I’ve been in the coaching
                    program with Mike and the results have been nothing short of amazing, I’ve been consistently losing
                    body fat all while increasing strength and endurance. I not only recommend working with Mike, I
                    highly encourage it.”</p>

                <p>Ben took his body to somewhere he didn’t think was possible. Not only did he learn exactly how to
                    gain the weight/size he wanted, but also he lost some body fat in the process. Super proud of the
                    progress he made in a short 12 week period.</p>

                <p>Mike definitely helped me develop a way better relationship with food and though it’s still a
                    struggle on some days, he’s proven that he’s always there to help you through it. Sometimes all you
                    need is that one person to help remind you why you’re working so hard in the first place and get
                    back on the right path. Mike does that for all of his clients (e.g. he actually gives a shit and
                    digs into the details to understand you as an individual client).</p>

                <img src="../images/online-testemonials-5.jpg" alt="">

                <p>After a few short months of working in Mike’s coaching program I started to notice a huge
                    transformation in myself. Not only was I getting stronger and losing fat, but everyone in my life
                    began remarking on how I didn't even seem like the same person anymore. I had a ton more energy and
                    a surprising amount of confidence.</p>
