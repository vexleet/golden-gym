            <h3>Sara Potter</h3>

            <p>“In 2015 I first learned about my macronutrients and went off the deep end following different online
                sites of how to put those numbers together for myself.
                Through that process I did lose weight, I went from 157 pounds down to 141 pounds, in four months, which
                seems great, but the problem was that I looked in the mirror at this weight of 141 and still wasnt
                happy. I’d cut so fast my mind couldn’t keep up, and every morning I’d wake up and hope and willed the
                scale to go down, even lower. I was napping every day post training, my nightly activities with my
                daughters were minimal because I had zero energy and my enthusiasm toward other activities and
                relationships was non-existent.
                That experience threw me into a tail spin back into a rabbit hole of an eating disorder that I had
                suffered from for the past decade and my body gained every ounce back, plus a few more pounds and took
                me an extended amount of time for my body and mind to bounce back from the extreme loss and gain and
                damage I did to my hormones.
                Finally, exhausted from food and low self esteem controlling me, my life, and my future, I decided to
                ask for help and come forward with my struggles and my experience.
                The day I put it out into the universe that I was ready for help I came across Mike’s Instagram account,
                and contacted him. He called me and talked to me on the phone for an hour! He wanted to know everything
                about my past experience with food, my goals, why I hadn’t reached them, and how was I going to set
                myself up for success, too. I was completely honest about my past with food and with what my goals truly
                were, not only physically but mentally, emotionally, and for my best self in all of my relationships,
                and activities.

                He immediately, said I wasn’t eating enough and started having me eat more. The moment I started with
                Mike, I let go of what the scale was saying and trusted the process of following what I was given and
                then giving my best in all aspects of my life with the freedom and the worry of food off of my
                shoulders.
                Mike, has been more involved than I could have asked for a nutrition coach; when I had my last
                competition he didn’t just give me some numbers to follow, he helped me set up my meals for timing for
                my workouts, and what foods would best process to help me perform and recover. He checked in with me
                multiple times throughout my workouts to see how I was feeling, and to just cheer me on and has become
                one of my biggest cheerleaders!
                Having a coach that cares, not because you are paying them but because they genuinely care for your
                well-being and progress, is life changing, especially when it comes to food and nutrition. Nutrition
                influences not only our physical appearance but our emotions, hormones, and our ability to believe in
                and build our self esteem and our belief in ourselves.
                I know I would not be where I am at right now, recovering from an eating disorder, loving and
                appreciating my body, enjoying the process and performing magic tricks in the gym, if it wasn’t for
                Mike’s sincerity in being a coach, and helping and encouraging me to be my best self and believe
                anything is possible.”

            <h3>Jeremiah Bair</h3>

            <p>Jeremiah, a personal trainer himself, came to us wanting to dial things in for a specific and
                individualized nutrition and training protocol. In the process he’s PR’d every single compound lift,
                increased his own knowledge for his clients, and cut 18lbs of PURE body fat in the process – going
                from 215-197lbs.</p>

            <h3>Trevor Gutting</h3>

            <p>Working with Golden Gym Performance for nutritional coaching was a game changer for me. I started off
                at 159 lbs with a goal to make lean gains. I have been an avid lifter and been eating healthy for
                the past four years. I came to a point where hit a plateau in my nutrition and my training progress
                stalled, so I made a choice to work with Mike after months of listening to his podcasts and
                devouring his content.

                Over seventeen weeks, I leaned out, built muscle, and gained strength. I got my first Dxa Scan after
                the seventeen weeks and I am 164 lbs and 9% body-fat. I just wish I would have gotten one beforehand
                to compare. I also learned about other factors that play a role in my training and health. I learned
                how much sleep and stress impact my training and overall health. Mike didn’t justprescribe me
                certain meals to eat every day. He provided me an ever-changing plan based on macros that supported
                my training.

                I have always held my self accountable for my nutrition and training, but working with Mike gave me
                the extra motivation to make progress. He had me track everything from my macros to my sleep. I had
                been tracking my food intake for awhile before working with Mike and it kept me on track. Mike had
                me track other biofeedback like sleep, mood, and stress also. Doing this made me more aware of the
                other factors that play into my health and how they affect my body. He doesn’t force you to follow
                any certain fad diet either. I got to eat the foods I enjoy.

                Going forward I plan to use the knowledge I gained from working with Mike and keep applying them in
                my own life, as well as, people I work with. If you are looking to take your training and/or
                nutrition to the next level. Or, you just need a kick in the butt, reach out to Mike. He will work
                with you to design a plan to become the best version of yourself.</p>

            <h3>John Hanna</h3>

            <p>I was concerned at first that an online program wouldn’t be as effective as working with someone who was
                local. I was also concerned I wouldn’t be able to make the fitness and nutrition program work for my
                busy life as dad of two teenagers, who works and is married to a woman who has different fitness goals.

                But I went for it and since I have seen a dramatic change in my body. At 47, I thought I was too old to
                ever see abs. But in only three months of consistent work, I’m in the best shape and health of my life.
                I’m stronger and my body fat is the lowest it’s ever been. I have abs!

                I like how involved and responsive Mike is during the process. I never feel that I’m given a plan and
                just left alone to do it. There’s ongoing communication and accountability – in a way that really works
                for me.

                Before the program I ate well, but now I understand how to make food work harder for me. This is
                knowledge I will use the rest of my life and that I share with my family.

                I get compliments for how “fit” I look. I wasn’t heavy before I started working with Mike, but now I’m
                leaner and have a more athletic build.

                I highly recommend Mike as a coach. Not only did he build me a program to achieve the results I
                identified at the start (fitness and nutrition), but he also cares about how I’m feeling as I go through
                the process, both physically and mentally. Mike is quick to make recommendations and/or changes to the
                program based on my current state. These adjustments are what keep me moving in the right direction.

                As someone who travels for business, I appreciate Mike providing the special workouts that work for the
                hotel gyms and the tips for eating out so I can stay on track. It makes a huge difference.

                Mike knows what he’s doing, but I am responsible for following (and trusting) the process and doing the
                work every day. I’ve done this and the results have come quickly. With Mike as my coach, I’m excited to
                see the positive changes continue.</p>
