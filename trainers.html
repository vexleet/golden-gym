                <h3>Mike Stramond</h3>
                <h6>Co-Founder</h6>

                <p>My name is Mike, but most people call me Boom-Boom.

                    Socrates the Philosopher once said,

                    <span class="quote">“No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is
                        a shame for a man
                        to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.”</span>

                    The reason I share that, is because that quote has always stuck with me…</p>

                <p>I decided to dedicate my life to health, fitness and nutrition. It has been the one thing I’ve truly
                    felt called to do.

                    <span>Which is why I started Golden Gym, a Lifestyle Training and Nutrition Coaching Company.</span>

                <h3>Claire Freemon</h3>
                <h6>Boxing Trainer</h6>

                <p>
                    I have been involved in sport and performance since I can remember. Judo at the age of 6 then
                    dabbled in distance running, athletics, kung fu when I found my love and passion in Boxing. I was a
                    professional fighter for almost 20 years, living in Thailand and fighting in the countries biggest
                    stadiums. I fought for my country (wining a sliver medal at the amateur championships) for British
                    titles and got to travel doing what I loved. After that I decided to become so I can help people. To
                    make a difference in peoples lives, to inspire, to educate, so people don’t go down the same path I
                    did, or make the same mistakes.

                <h3>Vincent Bryant</h3>
                <h6>Yoga Trainer</h6>

                <p>
                    I got into sports (track, volleyball, football etc) in school I started coaching younger teams, even
                    if I didn’t know what exactly I was doing at the time. I am a helper and teacher by nature so it
                    just felt like a normal thing to do. Later on, even though I was able to “help” others in my
                    profession as a Police Officer, I missed the focus on physical health in the job and realized that
                    coaching really was what I wanted to do. In addition to that, people around me and at my CrossFit
                    box had been asking for my help anyway after I successfully found a way to eat without restriction
                    and change my body composition and performance for the better. Making this my career simply means I
                    get to live out my actual personality to its fullest.
