                <h4>Travel Plans and Accommodation</h4>

                <p>Because we personally travel as often as possible and work with MANY entrepreneurs or traveling
                    workers, we know how difficult it can be to stick to the plan on the road. Don’t worry about all
                    that, we got you covered!
                    We will contact the hotel or place of stay and create an adjustable training program to fit whatever
                    is available for you to work with. We then search surrounding areas to help you come up with an
                    appropriate nutritional strategy to enjoy the area while keeping your diet on track.</p>
